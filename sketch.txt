    Your smile
    Your laughter
    Your eyes
    Your intelligence
    Your voice
    Your style
    Your energy
    Your humor
    Your opinions
    Your hair
    Your scent
    Your warmth
    Your hug
    Your personality
    Your love
    You're all my favorite songs trapped in a personality
    I like the way you make me feel even when you're nowhere near
    You have a sweet soul
    For me, there is only you
    I close my eyes to see you
    You're my favorite person
    Distance means nothing when the person means everything
    Loving you is easy
    Your name is my favorite
    You make me the luckiest person ever
    You're the prettiest
    You're the best gift
    You're all I need
    You're my everything
    You're special to me
    A soul like yours is worth loving
    I love talking to you
    I smile more because of you
    You're my favorite reason to lose sleep
    All I want to be is where you are
    Distance won't change my love for you
    You may not be in front of me, but you're all I see
    You're lovely
    You're my favorite thing to dream about
    Winning life cause I have you
    Your nails
    Every time I look in your eyes, I look away mesmerized
    Your eyebrows
    I love being in love with you
    You're something I look forward to
    Happiness has 9 letters but mine has 6
    You're the reason I wake up smiling
    Thank you for being you
    How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard
    I never want to stop making memories with you
    My heart finds its home in your laughs
    To be loved by you is an honor
    Nothing is impossible if it's for you
    I'll love you on your hardest days
    You stole my heart, but I'll let you keep it
    Anything I do, I think about you
    I built you a home in my heart
    You're my everything
    For you I'm infinite
    When I'm with you my heart rests
    With a heart like that, you deserve the world
    I see you in all my favorite songs
    No words can fully describe all the feelings I have for you
    You make me smile so easily
    The world seems kinder with you by my side
    May the wind carry my love to you
    I'd rather hear your silence over anyone else's voice
    You are a blessing in my life
    Every time I talk to you my day gets better
    When I think about love, I think about you
    
    I will choose you in every lifetime
I wish I could give you every flower I find
    Everything is so much softer and so much sweeter with you
    I'm so glad I found you
    Your laugh makes my heart melt
As soon as I wake up, I check my phone, hoping there's a message from you
Everything is better when I'm with you
    There's not a single second where I do not wish to be by your side
    I will never get tired of loving you
    Seeing you happy means the world to me
    Every day is a day closer to the future that we planned together
    You are every lovely word I could think of
    There is so much to love about you
    All you are is all I'll ever need
You kiss my heart like no other
I love you with my whole heart
You should see my smile when I'm texting you
